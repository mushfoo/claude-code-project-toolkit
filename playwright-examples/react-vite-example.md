# React/Vite Playwright Testing Example

This example shows how to customize the Playwright testing templates for a React/Vite project similar to Puka Reading Tracker.

## UI/UX Testing with Playwright

### ðŸŽ­ **Browser-Based User Experience Testing**

While unit tests verify code behavior, Playwright tests validate actual user experience in real browsers. Use Playwright to ensure the UI works as intended across different devices and interaction patterns.

### **When to Use Playwright Testing**
- **Before PR Creation**: Test core user flows on mobile (375px) and desktop viewports
- **After Major UI Changes**: Verify interactions still meet <100ms response requirement
- **Epic/Feature Completion**: Validate acceptance criteria with real user journeys
- **Mobile-First Validation**: Confirm touch targets, one-handed operation, responsive behavior
- **Performance Validation**: Ensure UI interactions meet the <100ms standard in actual browsers

### **Required Test Scenarios for Puka Reading Tracker**
- **Core User Flow**: Add book â†’ update progress â†’ filter by status â†’ search
- **Progress Management**: Test +10%, +25%, Done âœ“ buttons for responsiveness
- **Filter Functionality**: Verify All/Want to Read/Reading/Finished tabs work correctly
- **Search Integration**: Confirm search works across different filter states
- **Mobile Viewport**: Test all interactions at 375px width (primary mobile target)
- **Toast Notifications**: Verify success/error messages appear and dismiss properly

### **Playwright Testing Commands**
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# In another terminal, delegate UI/UX testing to a sub-agent
claude "Create a Task agent to test the core user flows with Playwright at localhost:5173. 
The agent should:
1. Navigate to the app and take screenshots
2. Test the add book â†’ progress update â†’ filter workflow
3. Verify mobile responsiveness at 375px
4. Validate performance of interactions (<100ms)
5. Report findings and any UX issues discovered"
```

### **React-Specific Testing Considerations**
- **Component State**: Verify React state updates reflect immediately in UI
- **Hook Behavior**: Test custom hooks work correctly during user interactions
- **Context Updates**: Ensure context changes propagate to all consuming components
- **Suspense Boundaries**: Validate loading states and error boundaries
- **React Router**: Test navigation maintains state and handles deep links
```

### Step 5: UI/UX Validation with Playwright
**Critical validation step using Task agents for systematic testing before PR creation.**

#### 5.1 Setup and Environment
1. **Start Development Server**: `npm run dev` (localhost:5173)
2. **Verify Test Environment**: Ensure all implemented features are accessible

#### 5.2 Core User Experience Validation
Delegate comprehensive testing to Task agents for systematic coverage:

```bash
# Primary user flow testing
claude "Create a Task agent to comprehensively test Puka Reading Tracker at localhost:5173:

CORE WORKFLOWS TO TEST:
1. New user onboarding experience (empty state â†’ first book)
2. Add book â†’ set progress â†’ update status workflow
3. Filter switching across all status types (Want to Read, Currently Reading, Finished)
4. Progress updates using inline sliders and quick action buttons
5. Search/filter combinations with live results

VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Take screenshots at each major step
- Test with realistic data (6+ books across different statuses)
- Verify all interactive elements respond within 100ms
- Document any broken workflows or UX friction points
- Report completion rates for each workflow"
```

#### 5.3 Mobile-First Testing (375px Viewport)
**Primary testing target - mobile experience is critical:**

```bash
# Mobile-first validation agent
claude "Create a Task agent for mobile UX testing on Puka Reading Tracker:

MOBILE TESTING PROTOCOL:
1. Set viewport to 375px width (iPhone SE standard)
2. Test one-handed operation patterns:
   - Thumb reach zones for all interactive elements
   - Filter tabs accessibility with single thumb
   - Progress sliders touch targets (minimum 44x44px)
   - Floating action button positioning and accessibility

MOBILE-SPECIFIC VALIDATIONS:
- Touch interactions feel responsive and natural
- No accidental taps due to element proximity
- Content remains readable without horizontal scrolling
- Filter tabs work effectively in mobile layout
- Progress indicators visible and functional
- All animations smooth at 60fps on mobile

DELIVERABLES:
- Mobile screenshot documentation
- Touch interaction performance report
- Recommendations for mobile UX improvements"
```
```

## Key Customizations for React/Vite

1. **Performance Requirements**: Set to <100ms for snappy interactions
2. **Mobile Viewport**: 375px (iPhone SE) as primary target
3. **Development Server**: Vite's default `npm run dev` on port 5173
4. **State Management**: Focus on React hooks and context
5. **Build Tool**: Vite-specific optimizations and HMR testing

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] React components render correctly
- [ ] State updates trigger immediate UI changes
- [ ] Vite HMR doesn't break functionality
- [ ] Mobile gestures work with React event handlers
- [ ] Performance meets <100ms requirement with React's virtual DOM
