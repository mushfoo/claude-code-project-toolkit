## Key Learnings from Solo Primary User Approach

### What Worked Well
1. **Immediate feedback loop**: As primary user, could test and iterate quickly
2. **Clear personal value assessment**: Easy to measure real impact on daily workflow
3. **Authentic feature prioritization**: Personal pain points drove genuine priorities
4. **Rapid iteration**: Could adjust features based on immediate personal experience

### Challenges Encountered
1. **Limited perspective**: Only one user's needs considered
2. **Feature scope tendency**: Personal interest sometimes conflicted with simplicity
3. **Success measurement**: Required discipline to track objectively
4. **Future planning**: Harder to anticipate needs beyond current usage patterns

### Recommendations for Solo Primary User Context
1. **Embrace the feedback advantage**: Use immediate personal experience for rapid iteration
2. **Document everything**: Personal usage patterns provide valuable data
3. **Stay disciplined on measurement**: Easy to skip tracking when you're the only user
4. **Plan for evolution**: Consider how needs might change as usage deepens
5. **Consider sharing early**: Personal tools often have broader appeal

This example demonstrates how the post-MVP process works when you're building primarily for yourself, with clear evaluation criteria, systematic measurement, and real results that validate the approach.
