# Initial PRD Creation Prompt

Use this prompt to generate a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) from initial project ideas.

---

**PROMPT:**

You are an experienced product manager creating a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a new project. Your goal is to transform the initial project concept into a structured, actionable document that will guide development.

## Project Information to Analyze

**Raw Project Concept:**
```
[PASTE YOUR PROJECT IDEA, GOALS, FEATURES, PROBLEMS TO SOLVE, TARGET USERS, ETC. HERE]
```

**Project Constraints:**
- Timeline: [MENTION TIMELINE IF KNOWN, OTHERWISE REMOVE THIS LINE]
- Budget: [MENTION BUDGET CONSTRAINTS IF KNOWN, OTHERWISE REMOVE THIS LINE]
- Technology preferences: [MENTION TECH STACK PREFERENCES IF ANY, OTHERWISE REMOVE THIS LINE]
- Team size: [MENTION TEAM SIZE IF KNOWN, OTHERWISE REMOVE THIS LINE]

## PRD Structure to Follow

Create a comprehensive PRD with these sections:

### 1. Executive Summary
- **Project Name & Version**: Clear project identification
- **Date & Status**: Current date and development phase
- **Vision Statement**: One sentence describing the ultimate goal
- **Success Metrics**: 3-4 measurable outcomes that define success

### 2. Problem Statement
- **Current Pain Points**: Specific problems this project will solve
- **Target User Personas**: Detailed description of primary, secondary, and tertiary users
- **Market Opportunity**: Why this problem is worth solving now

### 3. Product Requirements

#### Core Functionality (MVP)
- Break down features into specific, testable requirements
- Focus on essential features that deliver core value
- Include acceptance criteria for each major feature

#### Advanced Features (Future Phases)
- Phase 2 and Phase 3 feature sets
- Clear dependency relationships between phases
- Rough effort estimates for future planning

### 4. Technical Architecture
- **Technology Stack Recommendations**: Specific technologies with rationale
- **Integration Strategy**: How components will work together
- **API Design**: Key endpoints and data flows
- **Security & Performance Requirements**: Non-functional requirements

### 5. Claude Code Development Considerations

#### Strengths to Leverage
- What Claude Code excels at for this type of project
- Development velocity advantages
- Quality assurance benefits

#### Development Strategy Adaptations
- **Requirements Precision**: How to provide detailed specifications
- **Test-Driven Development**: Testing approach and coverage goals
- **Continuous Feedback**: How to gather and incorporate feedback
- **Technology Stack Optimizations**: Best tools for Claude Code development

### 6. User Stories & Acceptance Criteria
- **Epic-level stories** organized by major functionality
- **Detailed user stories** with specific acceptance criteria
- **Edge cases and error scenarios** to consider

### 7. Implementation Roadmap
- **Phase 1 (MVP)**: Week-by-week breakdown with specific deliverables
- **Phase 2**: Enhanced features and timeline
- **Phase 3**: Production-ready improvements
- **Risk mitigation strategies** for each phase

### 8. Definition of Done
- **MVP Ready Criteria**: Specific, testable completion requirements
- **Technical Performance Standards**: Measurable performance targets
- **Integration & Deployment Standards**: Deployment and compatibility requirements
- **Code Quality Standards**: Testing, documentation, and maintainability requirements
- **User Validation**: How success will be measured with real users

### 9. Success Criteria & Metrics
- **Development Velocity Metrics**: How to measure development progress
- **Quality Assurance Standards**: Testing and reliability targets
- **User Experience Metrics**: How users will benefit from the solution

### 10. Risk Assessment
- **Technical Risks**: Development and integration challenges
- **Product Risks**: User adoption and market fit concerns
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Specific plans to address each risk

## Instructions for Creation

1. **Ask Clarifying Questions**: If any aspect of the project concept is unclear, ask specific questions to gather missing information.

2. **Be Specific and Actionable**: Every requirement should be clear enough that a developer can implement it without additional clarification.

3. **Focus on User Value**: Ensure every feature directly addresses user pain points or delivers measurable value.

4. **Consider Claude Code Workflow**: Optimize the requirements for rapid development with Claude Code, including specific guidance on testing, architecture, and development practices.

5. **Include Realistic Timelines**: Based on the scope, provide realistic estimates for development phases.

6. **Make it Testable**: Every requirement should have clear acceptance criteria that can be objectively verified.

## Questions to Address

Before writing the PRD, please ask any clarifying questions about:
- **User personas**: Who exactly will use this product?
- **Core value proposition**: What's the primary problem being solved?
- **Technical constraints**: Any specific technology requirements or limitations?
- **Success definition**: How will we know this project succeeded?
- **Scope boundaries**: What is explicitly NOT included in this project?

Please analyze the project concept provided and create a comprehensive PRD following this structure. Start by asking any necessary clarifying questions, then proceed with the complete document.

## Output Requirements

**Save the completed PRD as**: `planning/prd.md`
- Create the planning/ directory if it doesn't exist
- Use git for version control instead of filename versioning
- This will be the single source of truth for project requirements
